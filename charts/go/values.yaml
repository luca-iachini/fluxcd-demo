## Node conatiners' resource requests and limits

##
resources:
  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.

  #   cpu: 100m
  #   memory: 128Mi

## Service paramaters
##
service:
  ## Service type
  ##
  type: ClusterIP
  ## HTTP Port
  ##
  port: 80
  ## Specify the nodePort value for the LoadBalancer and NodePort service types.
  ## ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport
  ##
  # nodePort:
  ## Set the LoadBalancer service type to internal only.
  ## ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#internal-load-balancer
  ##
  # loadBalancerIP:
  ## Provide any additional annotations which may be required. This can be used to
  ## set the LoadBalancer service type to internal only.

## Ingress paramaters
##
ingress:
  ## Set to true to enable ingress record generation
  ##
  enabled: false

  ## The list of hostnames to be covered with this ingress record.
  ## Most likely this will be just one host, but in the event more hosts are needed, this is an array
  hosts:
    []
    # - name: go.local

    ## Set this to true in order to enable TLS on the ingress record
    ##
    # tls: false

    ## If TLS is set to true, you must declare what secret will store the key/certificate for TLS
    ##
    # tlsSecret: go.local-tls

    ## Ingress annotations done as key:value pairs
    ## For a full list of possible ingress annotations, please see
    ## ref: https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md
    ##
    # annotations:
    #  kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
  secrets:
  ## If you're providing your own certificates, please use this to add the certificates as secrets
  ## key and certificate should start with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- or
  ## -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  ##
  ## name should line up with a tlsSecret set further up
  ## If you're using cert-manager, this is unneeded, as it will create the secret for you if it is not set
  ##
  ## It is also possible to create and manage the certificates outside of this helm chart
  ## Please see README.md for more information
  # - name: go.local-tls
  #   key:
  #   certificate

## Liveness and Readeness parameters
probe:
  liveness:
    ## Define liveness path
    ##
    path: /health
  readiness:
    ## Define readiness path
    ##
    path: /health
